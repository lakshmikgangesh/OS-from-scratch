# OS-from-scratch

This repository contains the code for my **crude** Operating System that has been coded from scratch. This was created for OS class' project component. To make your own, check out the details on my report https://github.com/lakshmikgangesh/OS-from-scratch/blob/dde004a4d642aedd6846a8d3d510039737b4ccf9/REPORT/report.pdf where I have detailed the step-by-step method to make this project. 

This OS has been made following the textbook https://littleosbook.github.io/

You will require a Linux Environment to follow this guide.
